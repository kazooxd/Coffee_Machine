A coffee machine where you have 3 options: Espresso, Latte and Cappuccino

It asks you how many coins you want to insert. If you have inserted to many coins, it will give you the change, if you have not inserted enough coins, it will give you a refund.

If you need a report of the resources inside the machine and the money made between "resource refills" you can type "report"

If you need to "service" the machine or for some reason you need to turn it off, you can type "off"
